# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Data Analysis (DA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** projects repository! This is a collection of my mini-projects where I explore and apply various data science techniques to real-world datasets. The goal is to showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

In this repository, you'll find a series of mini-projects that cover different stages of the data science workflow, starting from data preprocessing, visualizations, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), to building machine learning models for predictions. Each project is designed to help me learn new concepts and improve my practical skills.

### Key Features:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: I demonstrate how to handle raw data by cleaning it, handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and performing data transformations to make it ready for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I use various data visualization techniques like bar plots, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: I build and evaluate models using different algorithms such as regression, classification (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression), and clustering (e.g., KMeans). I also assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and R².

4. **Mini Projects**: Each mini-project focuses on solving a specific problem, and the results are presented step by step. These projects help me apply the knowledge gained in real-world contexts.

### Why Follow This Repo?

* **Hands-on Learning**: Every project is designed to show the practical application of various techniques.
* **Clear Documentation**: All projects are documented in Jupyter Notebooks with code, explanations, and visualizations.
* **Regular Updates**: As I continue learning and experimenting, I’ll be adding new projects to this repository.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to any project. I'm open to suggestions and collaborations. Happy learning!
