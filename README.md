Hospital Stay Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
üìä Project Overview
This mini project focuses on analyzing and building predictive models using hospital stay data in JSON format. The objective is to derive insights from the dataset, identify important features, and build models for clustering and classification tasks. The final goal is to predict the risk of mortality and provide valuable insights for healthcare decision-making.

üîç Key Tasks
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Loaded data from a JSON file.

Handled missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical variables using label encoding.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized data with various plots (bar plots, box plots, violin plots, and pie charts).

Extracted insights on factors influencing the length of stay and mortality.

3. Clustering (KMeans):
Applied KMeans clustering to analyze patterns in length_of_stay.

Validated and interpreted cluster results.

4. Classification (Random Forest):
Developed a Random Forest classifier to predict apr_risk_of_mortality.

Achieved ~81.2% accuracy.

Evaluated model using confusion matrix and classification report.

5. Final Documentation:
Documented model performance, insights, and data processing steps in a Jupyter Notebook.

üìÅ Files Included
final_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and findings.

dataset.json: The raw dataset in JSON format used for analysis (replace with the actual file if necessary).

requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
